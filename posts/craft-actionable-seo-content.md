## What to Avoid When Writing SEO-Focused Content Briefs

We all want our content to be successful. And you already know what to do to create a great brief. But it's also critical to avoid pitfalls when creating your SEO content briefs. Here are some common mistakes to avoid:

1.  Overemphasizing Keyword Search Volume

While using keywords with high search volume is great for ranking, don't prioritize it over search intent.

At best, targeting keywords because of volume can lead to vanity traffic. They hardly convert to sales. And at its worst, you may be pitching to the wrong crowd because their search intent is not what you're offering. Remember that your goal is to attract people most likely to convert.

1.  Blindly Depending on Keyword Tools

Keyword research tools are excellent for content planning but are not always accurate indicators of current search demand. Ensure you cross-check your suggestions with other tools like Google Trends to get the latest data.

1.  Overemphasizing on Keywords

Your SEO content brief should have primary and secondary keywords. Still, it's crucial not to instruct your team of writers to focus solely on including key phrases a specific number of times. This could lead to keyword stuffing–which Google frowns at.

Instead, focus on making the content answer your audience's questions. It should address concerns related to your keyword. That way, search engines know what your content is about while satisfying your website visitors.
