In some online chat rooms I frequent, there's a recurring issue where someone enters and asks,

> AnonB:
>
> Any TypeScript experts here?

This approach is problematic for a few reasons. What the person is essentially inquiring is,

> AnonB:
>
> Are there any TypeScript experts willing to delve into my issue, whatever it may be, even if it's unrelated to TypeScript or if someone unfamiliar with TypeScript could possibly answer my question?

This request goes beyond its apparent intention. It solicits a commitment, questions people's confidence in their abilities, and needlessly excludes others. I often answer queries about languages or libraries I haven't used because, from a programmer's perspective, the solutions often boil down to common sense.

Alternatively, it can be interpreted as,

> AnonB:
>
> I have a TypeScript question, but I'm too lazy to articulate it unless there's someone in the channel who might be able to answer it.

Which is simply lazy. If you're unwilling to put in the effort to solve your problem, why should we?

The solution isn't to ask if you can ask but just to ask. Someone idling on the channel, glancing occasionally, is unlikely to respond to your "asking to ask" question. However, a well-described problem may catch their interest and prompt a response.

To sum up, instead of asking _"Any TypeScript experts around?"_, it's more effective to ask _"How do I accomplish [problem] with TypeScript and [other relevant info]?".
